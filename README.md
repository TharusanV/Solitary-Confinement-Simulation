<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About
In the Netflix TV series tiled 'Alice in Borderland' based on the japanese manga with the same name, players are forced to compete in dangerous games. 
One of the games is titled "Solitary Confinement with the Jack of Hearts", set in a prision, each player wears a collar that displays a card suit on the back of their collar. Renditioning everyone unable to see their own suit.
Each round players are free to talk to other players. At the end of the round, player's must return to their cell to announce their suit. If theyâ€™re correct, they move onto the next round. If the player remains silent or says the wrong suit, the collar explodes.
With the prision having no reflective surfaces, players are forced to either trust others or take a guess. 
Among the players is the Jack of Hearts. The game is cleared if (a) the Jack of Hearts guesses their suit wrong. (b) If two players remain (Jack of Hearts included), only the Jack of Hearts will live, since their identity will become apparent.
The prision contains 6 months supply of food/water. Each round last one hour therefore sleep depravation will be the only issue.
Rules: (1) No more than 1 person may reside inside a locked cell. (2) Players may not obstruct other players from entering a cell. (3) Players may not revoke another's ability to announce their own suit.
My ABM model aims to simulate this game with the use of Python and Mesa.
